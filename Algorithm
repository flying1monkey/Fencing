Query for yard width
Query for yard length
Calculate perimeter 
	perimeter = 2*length + 2*width
Query for fencing type 
	wood ($25) or chain link ($15)
Query for number of gates 
	at least one, no more than three ($150 each)
Calculate total
	fencing=perimeter*type
	gate price is 150*number of gates
	6% tax rate (0.06)-1.06 is tax rate plus cost
	50 for building permit, which is not taxed
	((perimeter*type)+(gates*150))*1.06)+50
